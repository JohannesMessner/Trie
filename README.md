# Trie
Console-based implementation of a Trie data structure.
Can be used to map strings to integers, e.g. saving points corresponding to names.

Supports a number of commands:
'add <name> <points>':      Lets you add a new entry consisting of a name and its corresponding point-value
'delete <name>':            Lets you delete an entry from the data structure
'change <name> <points>':   Lets you change an entry's point-value to a new value\n"
'points <name>':            Lets you request the point value corresponding to a name\n"
'trie':                     Gives you a visual representation of the data structure and all its entries
'new':                      Deletes the data structure and creates a new, empty one to work with
'quit':                     Quits the application
'help':                     Prints this message
 
 You cane also call all of these commands by using a prefix of the corresponding command.
